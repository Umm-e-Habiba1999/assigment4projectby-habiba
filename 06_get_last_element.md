<!-- Problem Statement
Fill out the function get_last_element(lst) which takes in a list lst as a parameter and prints the last element in the list. The list is guaranteed to be non-empty, but there are no guarantees on its length. -->


def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    

    # Takes the length of the list and minuses 1 since they are zero-indexed (we start counting at 0)
print(lst[len(lst) - 1])

# The line below works too!!
# print(lst[-1])
